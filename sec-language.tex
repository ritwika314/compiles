\section{\lgname language design}
\label{sec:language}

In this section, we present the syntax and the semantics of \lgname.
%
%\subsection{Synchronous run-time system }
%
When a \lgname application is deployed on a fleet of robots, multiple instances of the same program runs on a collection of $\NMAX$ robots.
There is a known set of identifiers $\UINS=\{0,1,\dots,\NMAX-1\}$, and each robot is assigned  a unique index $\myuin \in \UINS$.
% Sayan. This is out of place here.
%Programmers can use $\NMAX$ and $\myuin$ as constant values in a \lgname program.
%
The robots communicate with each other through distributed shared memory. 
The execution of the \lgname program advances in a synchronous, \emph{round-by-round} fashion, where each round lasts for $\delta$ time,
and $\delta >0$ is a platform specific execution parameter.
During this period, the robots compute, move, and 
communicate with each other through distributed shared memory. 



\subsection{Syntax}\label{sec:syntax}

\reffig{partial-syntax} shows the partial grammar of \lgname syntax.
Each robot program consists of
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item declarations of the interfaces between the program and the sensor/actuator modules,
\item declarations of shared and local program variables, and
\item events, consisting of preconditions and effects.
\end{inparaenum}
Robot programs (rule \emph{Program}) first can import sensor/actuator modules.
The module import grammar production specifies the interfaces or ports:
it contains all input and output ports for actuators (\emph{APorts}) and sensors (\emph{SPorts}) that the program uses.
%The program can also contain shared and local declarations.
To summarize, there are following three types of names for reading/writing values:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item \emph{Sensor and actuator ports} are used to read from sensor ports and write to actuator ports of controllers.
\item \emph{Local program variables} record the state of the program.
\item \emph{Distributed shared variables} are used for coordination across robots. All shared variables can be read by all participating robots; an
      \textbf{allwrite} variable can be written by any participating robot; while an 
      \textbf{allread} variable can be written only by a single-writer.
\end{enumerate}

User can then optionally specify a statement to set the initial values of program variables~(rule~\emph{Init}).
The main body of the program is a sequence of events (rule~\emph{Event}) which include a Boolean \textbf{pre}condition
and an \textbf{eff}ect.
The effect of an event is also a statement~(rule~\emph{Effect}).
We skip the syntax rules for statements, expressions, data types, and functions due to the page limit.
A statement~(rule~\emph{Stmt}) in \lgname resembles those in most imperative languages and includes
conditional statements, function calls, assignments, blocks of statements, atomic statements for mutual exclusion, etc.
Mutual exclusion is always an essential feature when shared variables are involved.
\lgname provides a locking mechanism using the keyword \textbf{atomic} to update the shared variable safely.
The user can also define functions and abstract data types (tuples of the basic data types).

In the syntax presented in \reffig{partial-syntax}, given an nonterminal \textit{NT},
{\it NT\textsuperscript{?}} means that it is optional in the syntax at that position,
{\it NT*} refers to zero or more occurrences,
and {\it NT\textsuperscript{+}} refers to one or more occurrences.
The expression $(E1\mid E2)$ denotes that one can use either $E1$ or $E2$.

\subsection{Koord semantics}
\label{sec:configs}

The semantics of a \lgname program execution is based on synchronous rounds divided into \emph{event transitions} and \emph{environment transitions} that update the \emph{system configuration}.
In each round, each robot performs at most one event.
The update performed by a single robot executing an event is modeled as an instantaneous transition that updates the program variables; however, different events executed by the different robots may interleave in an arbitrary sequence.
In between the events of successive rounds, $\delta>0$ duration of time elapses, the program variables remain constant while the values held by the sensor and actuator ports may change. 
%This is captured by an {\em environment transition\/}.
%The \lgname program can only read the sampled values from and write to the ports every $\delta$ time.
%\sayan{Need to choose the words carefully here. We should discuss. Whether the variables change value continuously or discretely is a modeling question and what we want to analyze.}
These are modeled as environment transitions that advance time as well as the sensor and actuator ports.
%
Thus, each round consists of a burst of (at most \NMAX) event transitions followed by an environment transition. This is a standard model for synchronous distributed systems where the speed of computation is much faster than the speed of communication and physical movement~\cite{lynch1996a,attiyawelch}. 

We now describe the system state, or \emph{system configurations} which we use to formalize \lgname semantics.

\paragraph{System configurations.}

A \emph{system configuration} is a tuple $\gconfig = (\lset_{i\in\UINS},{S},\tau,\turn)$, where

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\lset_{i\in\UINS}$ or $\lset$ in short is an indexed set of \emph{robot configurations}--one for each participating robot.
      $\lconfig{i}$ refers to the configuration of the $i$-th element, i.e., the $i$-th robot in the system.
\item ${S} : \Var \mapsto \Val$ is the {\em global context\/}, mapping all shared variable names to their values.
\item $\tau\in \nnreals$ is the {\em global time\/}.
\item $\turn\in\{\prog,\env\}$ is a binary \emph{bookkeeping} variable determining whether program or environment transitions are being processed.
\end{enumerate}

Bookkeeping variables are invisible in the language syntax, and only used in the semantics.


\paragraph{Robot configurations.}

A \emph{robot configurations} is used to specify the semantics of each robot.
Given a \lgname program $P$, we can define $\Var$ be the set of variables,
$\Val$ be the set of values that an expression in \lgname can evaluate to,
$\Cfield$ be the set of sensor and actuator ports of the controller being used,
and $\Event$ the set of events in $P$.
%
\marginpar{\scriptsize\sayan{Cfield is an odd name. All of the above has to be defined after we fix a Koord program $P$.}}
%
The configuration of an robot is a tuple $\agnt = ({M},\cp,\turn)$, where

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item ${M} : \Var \mapsto \Val$ is its \emph{local context} mapping both local and shared variables to values.
      Note that this implies $M$ includes a copy of shared variable values.
\item $\cp : \Cfield \mapsto \Val$ is the mapping of sensor and actuator ports to values.
\item $\turn \in \{\prog,\env\}$ is a bookkeeping variable indicating whether this robot should be executing a program or environment transition.
\end{enumerate}
For readability, we use the dot (``$.$'') notation to access components of a robot configuration $\agnt$.
For example, $\agnt.M$ means accessing the local context $M$ in the tuple $\agnt$.

The controller module is modeled as a black-box functions
$f: [\Cfield \mapsto \Val] \times \nnreals \mapsto [\Cfield \mapsto \Val]$.
That is, given old sensor and actuator values as well as a period of continuous time,
$f$ evaluates the physical dynamics and returns new values for all sensor and actual ports.

\caption{Partial Semantic Rules for \lgname.}\label{fig:partial-semantics}
\end{figure}

For simplicity, we describe only part of semantic rules of \lgname that is above event level.
As an example for statement level semantic rules,
rule~\StmtSeqRuleOne and \StmtSeqRuleTwo show how a statement representing a sequence of statements should be executed.
The detailed statement and expression level semantics of \lgname is available in the extended version of the paper~\cite{}.
\sayan{Do they allow appendices?}\chiao{No appendix, but supplemental materials can be provided separately.}

\paragraph{Per Robot Semantics.}
First, we present the semantics of executing an event for each robot,
which will help us discuss the semantics of the whole system.
All rules for statement semantics are of type
\[
\stmtrule \subseteq (\pws \times \pwl\times (\pwstmt \cup \{\SelectEvent, \EndEvent\})) \mapsto \wp(\pws\times \pwl \times \pwstmt\cup \{\EndEvent\}),
\]
where $\pwstmt$ refers to the set of all possible statements allowed by \lgname syntax.
This relation takes as input a tuple of (1) a global context, (2) an robot configuration, and (3) a statement,
and maps it to a set of such tuples.
The symbols `\SelectEvent' and `\EndEvent' are not in \lgname but internal syntactic structures.
`\SelectEvent' is to denote nondeterministic selection of events,
and `\EndEvent' is to indicate an ``empty" statement.

Rule~\SelectEventRule in \reffig{partial-semantics} shows that any event may be executed when the precondition $Cond$ is evaluated to true,
and by replacing \SelectEvent with the event effect $\mathit{Body}$, it ensures only one event is selected and executed.
The event effect is then executed following the semantics of each statement in $\mathit{Body}$.
Rule~\SkipEventRule allows the robot to skip the event completely.
At the end of the event, the sequence of statements becomes empty~`\EndEvent'.
Rule~\EndEventRule then makes sure the $\turn$ of the robot is set to $\env$ indicating that
an environment transition will occur afterwards.

Similarly, we define the semantics of how each robot interacts with environment including other robots.
The environment transition rule is of type
\[
\envtrans \subseteq (\pws \times \pwl) \mapsto \wp(\pws\times \pwl),
\]
which takes a global context and a robot configuration as input.
Rule~\RobotEnvRule simply states that the new local context $M'$ is
old local context $M$ updated with the global context $S$;
thus ensuring that all robots have consistent shared variable values before the next program transition.
New sensor readings $\cp'$ is then obtained by evaluating the black-box dynamics $f$ with time $\delta$.
In an actual execution, the controller would run the program on hardware,
whose sensor ports evolve for $\delta$ time between program transitions.
This formalization allows the ports to behave arbitrarily over $\delta$-transitions.
In verification of invariant properties,
additional assumptions will be needed to constrain the behavior of the sensor and actuator ports.
Finally, the $\turn$ of the robot is set back to $\prog$.


\paragraph{Global Semantics.}

With the event semantic for each robot, we can then define the execution for the distributed \lgname program.
The rewrite rule is a mapping from an initial system configuration to a set of configurations.
It has the type
\[
\rightarrow_G\ \subseteq \pwg \mapsto \wp(\pwg),
\]
where $\pwg$ is the set of all possible global configurations.

Rule~\EventTransRule expresses that starting from a global configuration $\gconfig = (\lset, S, \tau, \prog)$,
a robot $i$ with the configuration $\lconfig{i}$ starts by selecting an enabled event,
executes the event via a sequence of $\stmtrule$ rewrites,
and sets its own $\turn$ to $\env$ at the end of the event execution.
The system goes from a configuration $\gconfig$ to $\gconfig^{\prime}= (\lsetp, S^{\prime}, \tau, \prog)$,
with possibly different robot configurations and global context depending on
whether any statement executed resulted in writes to shared variables.
The system can display nondeterministic behaviors arising from different robots executing their events in different orders.
After all robots enter the $\env$ turn, rule~\EndProgTransRule sets the global $\turn$ from $\prog$ to $\env$
indicating the end of program transition, and an environment transition will occur afterwards.

Rule~\EnvTransRule shows the semantics of the system configuration after rule~\EndProgTransRule.
This rule synchronizes the environment transitions of each robot and
ensure that the global time $\tau$ advances to $\tau + \delta$.


\subsection{Synchronization and Consistency}
\label{sec:sync}

Following our semantic rules in \refsect{semantics},
careful readers would notice all event transitions of \lgname program takes \emph{zero} time,
whereas the environment transitions take $\delta$ time for the evolution of the sensor and the actuator ports
together with the update of the local context from the global context.
In other words, we assume the 
In this section, we discuss the design rationale of this abstraction

%\subsubsection{Shared memory updates}
%
% The set of all copies of the local copies shared variables can be seen as the \emph{distributed shared memory}. The correctness of a program relies on consistent values of the robots' local values of shared variables. When an robot writes to a variable, it updates its local copy and our implementation of the $\lgname$ framework uses message passing to inform the other robots of the change.
%%

\rg{robot local states and propagation over messages.}

The following are the timing assumptions on \lgname programs.
\begin{assumption}
    A program transition has zero logical execution time, and an environment transition has $\delta$ execution time.
\end{assumption}
This assumption is reasonable if the time taken to complete a program transition step is negligible compared to $\delta$.  The $\lgname$ middleware ensures that the participating robots begin executing their events synchronously.

\begin{assumption}
    \label{shared}
    Shared memory updates are propagated to all robots within one round. That is, given a state $\vs\in C$, for every  $i,j \in \UINS$, for a shared variable $v$, $\vs.v_i = \vs.v_j$.
\end{assumption}
The \lgname middleware uses message passing to implement shared memory, and compared to $\delta$, the time taken to observe a shared memory update as a received message from the time that it is sent is much smaller. We therefore can assume that in this setting, the shared memory semantics of \lgname wherein an update is visible in the next round of program transitions, is a reasonable implementation deliverable.
