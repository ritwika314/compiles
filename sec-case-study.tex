\chiao{<= 3 pages}

In this section, we present the formal definition of \appname problem.
Then we develop a state machine model executing in the physical environment,
and finally, using this model we show that it meets the key requirements of the problem.
One of the outcomes of this analysis is the identification of a list of precise assumptions of sensors,
quantization, and \sayan{fill in}, that need to be checked separately for obtaining end-to-end, system-level guaranteed.

\subsection{Implementation of Modules}

\paragraph{Sound Mapping from Synchronized Sensor Data~(ScanToMap).}
To generate a 2D map from the scan data,
it is required to synchronize the current vehicle position and the Lidar scan data.
An existing solution is to filter the time stamps of both sensor data streams
and only choose pairs of data within a given time difference threshold $\epsilon$.
This can be achieved by \texttt{ApproximateTimeSynchronizer} in the ROS package named \texttt{message\_filter}.
The frequency of the synchronized data is then limited to the sensor with the lowest frequency.
In our simulation, the lowest frequency is 100 Hz for sensing the vehicle position and sufficient for updating the map.

The Lidar scan data provided in the tool chain are pairs of a distance to obstacles and an angle with respect to the heading angle of the vehicle.
To implement ScanToMap, it is then straightforward to compute the positions of obstacles and mark occupied grid rectangles,
and to mark a rectangle obstacle free is to simply check if all four corners of a grid rectangle are covered in the scan.
The time difference $\epsilon$ however can introduce an error between real and perceived distances to obstacles.
Reducing this error is beyond the scope of this work.
Our implementation of ScanToMap therefore may falsely mark a grid rectangle as occupied when obstacles are in nearby grids.

\paragraph{Path to Frontier~(PathToFrontier).}
In the \toolname tool chain, several path planning algorithms are already available.
We particularly select the Rapidly exploring Random Tree with near neighbor search and rewiring tree~(RRT*) algorithm.
It is able to avoid obstacles and is fine tuned to the car model for simulation.
Our implementation hence only needs to choose a point in frontier grid rectangles and provide the positions of obstacles.
To choose such a point, a basic solution is to use Breadth-First Search~(BFS) on the map and seek for a unexplored grid rectangle.
BFS ensures that either all reachable grid rectangles are marked,
or there are connected unoccupied rectangles to an unexplored rectangle, and hence a path must exist.
Nonetheless, it does not guarantee that the underlying path planner can always find a path because,
for instance, the car is incapable of make sharp turns.
Our soundness claim still holds under such circumstance, but we may not be able to progress even when paths to frontier exist.
