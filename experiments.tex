Mutual exclusion is always an essential feature when shared variables are involved. $\lgname$ provides a locking mechanism using the keyword $\mathit{atomic}$, which the $\mathit{Assign}$ event uses to update the shared list of tasks $\mathit{taskList}$ safely. $\lgname$ supports two types of shared variables, multiwriter-multireader (\emph{allwrite}), and singlewriter-multireader (\emph{allread}) shared variables, whose functionality is as their names suggest.

The implementation of $\mathit{Motion}$ controller involves, for example, path planners, and platform-specific steering and throttle controllers, and drivers for specific positioning systems.
