Mutual exclusion is always an essential feature when shared variables are involved. $\lgname$ provides a locking mechanism using the keyword $\mathit{atomic}$, which the $\mathit{Assign}$ event uses to update the shared list of tasks $\mathit{taskList}$ safely. $\lgname$ supports two types of shared variables, multiwriter-multireader (\emph{allwrite}), and singlewriter-multireader (\emph{allread}) shared variables, whose functionality is as their names suggest. 
 %
The implementation of $\mathit{Motion}$ controller involves, for example, path planners, and platform-specific steering and throttle controllers, and drivers for specific positioning systems. 

We developed a simulator \reffig{simulator} for $\lgname$ applications within the CyPhyHouse framework to enable the user a way of testing their discrete event loop with simple motion models to test and debug the application program logic. The CyPhyHouse simulator uses motion automata, which can be provided any programmable dynamics to simulate the robot dynamics. The simulated sensed data is also provided realistic noises and dynamics to mimic actual system dynamics. The communication protocols are also a part of the simulator communication module. The time between two computational steps (or discrete event loop iterations) is used to propagate messages to implement shared memory as in the actual hardware stack.
