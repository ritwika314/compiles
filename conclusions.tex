We designed an event driven language, $\lgname$,  for distributed coordination and control, and implemented its formal executable semantics.
We demonstrated the efficacy of $\lgname$ in succinctly writing multi-robot applications involving discributed coordination, different types of sensing and actuation, and path planning using three case studies. The shared memory based communication model we used in $\lgname$ enables us to naturally and succinctly model multi-robot and distributed systems applications. Our work is a move in the direction of providing users without programming expertise in domains like controller theory, robotics motion control, or network protocols, with an ability to safely program distributed applications which may have cyberphysical interactions.

\subsection{Future work}
In applications such as \Task and \dmap, progress, while more difficult to prove than safety, is as important of a concern. We believe fairness requirements can be formalized, just as we formlized the assumptions and proof obligations in this work. We plan to extend this work to include verification of progress properties under fairness constraints for applications that can already be encoded in \lgname.
