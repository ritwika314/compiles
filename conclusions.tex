\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

Our work in the design and implementation of $\lgname$ is a move in the direction of providing users without programming expertise in domains like controller theory, robotics motion control, or network protocols, with an ability to safely program distributed applications which may have cyberphysical interactions. To this end, we demonstrated the efficacy of $\lgname$ in succinctly writing multi-robot applications involving discributed coordination, different types of sensing and actuation, and path planning using three case studies.\rg{need one line saying how unique we are/how much better we are}
       A major of developing an executable semantics in \K is that the resultant language design is highly extendable and customizable, while retaining the same framework for formal analysis. Progress properties, while more difficult to prove than safety, are just as important of a concern in distributed applications such as these. We plan to extend this work to include specification and verification of progress properties under fairness constraints for $\lgname$ applications.
