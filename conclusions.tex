We demonstrated the efficacy of $\lgname$ in succinctly writing multi-robot applications involving discributed coordination, different types of sensing and actuation, and path planning using three case studies. While still in the development stages, \CyPhyHouse has been used by more than 25 individuals for programming, simulating, and testing other applications like formation flight, and surveillance. Our experiences suggest the toolchain can indeed lower the barrier for entry into the distributed robotics.
