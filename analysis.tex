% initial states of $\A$. 


The individual soundness requirement of the mapping problem is then captured by the following invariant of $\A$. The variable $\gmap$ captures.
\begin{invariant}
\label{inv:ind-sound}
For all $i \in [N]$,  $\vs\in Q, \vs$
\end{invariant}

We omit the initialization of the mappings in the presentation of the program in \reffig{mapapp}. From our assumption on the initial conditions discussed in \refsect{prelims}, for each robot $i$, its initial state $s_i$, $s_i.M.\lmap[q_0] = 0$ where $q_0\in Q$ is the grid rectangle the robot starts in. We also assumed that $\sensarea(q_0)\neq \phi$, and assume that $s_i.M.\lmap(q) = \sensfunc(\sensarea(q))$ . $s_i.M.\gmap$ is initialized as $s_i.M.\gmap[q] = -1$ for all $q\in Q$. Thus, for an initial state $s_i$, both $s_i.M.\lmap$ and $s_i.M.\gmap$ are sound mappings.

The consistency requirement of the mapping problem is captured by the following invariant of $\A$
\begin{invariant}
\label{inv:consistency}
For all $i \in [N]$
\end{invariant}

    Given $\map_i$, $\map_j$, and $q\in Q_i \cup Q_j$ , let $\map_i(q) = 1$, and $\map_j(q) = 0$. Suppose $\map_i$ is sound, then $\world_Q(q) = 1$, which implies $\map_j$ is not sound. By the same argument, if $\map_j$ is sound, $\map_i$ is not. Each mapping in a set of proposed mappings $\left\{\map_i\right\}_{i\in [N]}$ can only be sound if they are pairwise consistent.

%Given a mapping $\map_i$, $\domain(\map_i)$ denotes $ Q_i \subset Q$, such that $\forall q \in Q_i \map_i(q) = 0 \vee \map_i(q) = 1$.
\begin{definition}
    \label{cons}
Consider a set of sound mappings $\left\{\map_i\right\}_{i\in[N]}$. The \emph{ combined mapping} described by $\map: Q^\prime \mapsto \left\{0,1\right\}$ where $Q^\prime = \bigcup_{i\in[N]} \domain(\map_i)$ , and $\exists j \in [N], q\in \domain(\map_j)\Rightarrow \map(q) = \map_j(q)$ is also sound.
\end{definition}

$\map$ is sound by construction, and consistency of the sound mappings it is constructed from.


Now we proceed to show that each of the events preserve these invariants. 
\paragraph{NewPoint}
In this event, the robot first updates its value of $s_i.M.\lmap$ from the currently known value of $s_i.M.\gmap$ where the operator $\oplus$ is defined as follows:
$$\forall q \in Q, f[q] \oplus g[q] = \mathit{Max}(f[q], q[q])$$

Given two sound maps $\lmap$ and $\gmap$, $\lmap \oplus \gmap$ corresponds to a combined map construction as outlined in \defn{cons}, and is sound. The event \emph{NewPoint} doesn't modify $s_i.M.\lmap$ further, and therefore, $\lmap$ remains \emph{sound} during the execution of this event.

%\begin{definition}
%    We say that $\Vec{x_n}\in D$ is \emph{reachable} from $\Vec{x_0}$ if there is a \emph{path} $p = \Vec{x_0},\Vec{x_1}, \Vec{x_2},\ldots, \Vec{x_n}$ , such that
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item $\forall i \in [0..n],\world_Q(\qfunc{\Vec{x_i}}) = 0$
%        \item a robot can move from $\Vec{x_i}$ to $\Vec{x_{i+1}}$ for $i \in [0..n]$, while staying within $\qfunc(\Vec{x_i}) \cup \qfunc(\Vec{x_{i+1}})$.
%    \end{itemize}
%\end{definition}
%
%A grid rectangle $q\in Q$ is reachable in general, if $\exists \Vec{x}\in D, q = \qfunc(\Vec{x})$ such that $\Vec{x}$ is reachable from either \begin{inparaenum} [(a)]
%                                                                                                                                                   \item the initial position of a robot, or \item another reachable point $\Vec{x^\prime}\in D$. We denote the reachability of a grid rectangle using a predicate $\mathit{Reach} : Q \mapsto \left\{\mathit{True}, \mathit{False}\right\}$, where $\mathit{Reach}(q) = \mathit{True}$ if its reachable,  $\mathit{False}$ otherwise.
%\end{inparaenum}
%
%\begin{definition}
%    Given a sound occupancy mapping $\map_i$, the \emph{frontier} of $\map_i$, denoted by $\ff(\map_i)$ is defined as follows:
%    $$ \left\{ q\in Q \mid Reach(q) \wedge \exists q \in \sensarea(\Vec{x}), q \notin \domain(\map_i)\right\} $$
%\end{definition}

In the event \emph{NewPoint}, the planner associated with the robot tries to find a path to a point on the \emph{frontier} of $s_i.M.\lmap$.
If the path is empty, then the robot does nothing, and attempts to execute this event in the next round. Otherwise, until the robot finishes traversing the path, the \emph{LUpdate} event is enabled.

\paragraph{LUpdate}
This event is enabled while the robot is traversing the path computed in \emph{NewPoint}: the robot hasn't finishing traversing the path. i.e the state $s_i$ of a robot satisfies that $s_i.\cp.\mathit{Motion.reached}  = \mathit{False}$.
Once the robot finishes traversing the path picked in \emph{NewPoint}, the \emph{GUpdate} event is enabled.


In the $GUpdate$ event, robot attempts to \emph{atomically} or in a mutually exclusive manner, update the value of $s_i.M.\gmap$ with  $s_i.M.\lmap$. Given that $\oplus$ preserves soundness, again, that given $s_i^\prime$ such that $\mathit{s_i^\prime \in \mathit{trans}(s_i,\mathit{GUpdate})}$,  $s_i^\prime.M.\gmap$ is sound if $s_i.M.\gmap$ and $s_i.M.\lmap$ are sound.

\begin{theorem}
    For the system of robots $[N]$ executing the $\lgname$ program shown in \reffig{mapapp}, the shared variable $\gmap$ represents a sound mapping of the domain $Q$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Given a robot $i$, its initial state $s_i$ satisfies $$\forall q \in Q, s_i.M.\gmap[q] = -1.$$ This represents a (vacuously) sound \qdfunc $\map$ where $\domain(\map) = \phi$.


    Consider a state $s_i^\prime$, where $s_i^\prime.M.\gmap$ is sound. If the soundness of $\gmap$ is preserved during the next round (i.e under execution of any enabled event), then by induction $\gmap$ always represents a sound mapping of the domain $Q$. \begin{itemize}
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \item $\forall s_i^{\prime\prime} \in \mathit{trans}(s_i^\prime,\mathit{NewPoint}), s_i^{\prime\prime}.M.\gmap = s_i^\prime.M.\gmap$. Thus, the soundness of $\gmap$ is preserved by this event.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \item $\forall s_i^{\prime\prime} \in \mathit{trans}(s_i^\prime,\mathit{LUpdate}), s_i^{\prime\prime}.M.\gmap = s_i^\prime.M.\gmap$. Thus, the soundness of $\gmap$ is preserved by this event.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \item $\forall s_i^{\prime\prime} \in \mathit{trans}(s_i^\prime,\mathit{GUpdate}), s_i^{\prime\prime}.M.\gmap = s_i^\prime.M.\gmap \oplus s_i^\prime.M.\lmap$. By definition of $\oplus$, if $s_i^\prime.M.\lmap$ is sound, then $s_i^{\prime\prime}.M.\gmap$ is also sound.
    \end{itemize}

    Therefore, to prove that all events preserve the soundness of $\gmap$, we must prove that $\lmap$ also represents a sound mapping of $Q$.\rg{Circular proof coming in here, need restatement, will work on it post comments}

\end{proof}
%\begin{lemma}
%    \label{ext}
%    Suppose robot $i$ is at $\pos(i)\in D$, and $\exists(q^\prime)\in \sensarea(\pos(i))$,
%    s.t $\map_i(q) = -1$. Consider a mapping, $\map^\prime_i:Q \mapsto \left\{-1,0,1\right\}$
%    such that, $\forall q\in Q \setminus \sensarea(\pos(i)), map^\prime_i(q) = map_i(q)$
%    and $\forall q \in \sensarea(\pos(i)), \map^\prime_i(q) = \world_Q(q)$.
%    Then, $\map^\prime_i(q)$ is sound if $\map_i$ is sound.
%\end{lemma}
%
%The proof for this is straightforward and follows from the definition of $\map^\prime_i$ combined with \defn{soundness}.
%
%Recall from the definition of the sensing area of a robot $i$ at $\pos(i)$, that it can reliably compute the ground truth mapping $\world_Q$ for all $q \in \sensarea(\pos(i))$. This lemma essentially states that given a sound occupancy mapping $\map_i$, it can be used to compute to another \emph{sound} occupancy mapping $\map^\prime_i$ by setting the values of $\map^\prime_i(\sensarea(\pos(i)))$ to the ground truth function.
%
%\begin{definition}
% We say that $\Vec{x_n}\in D$ is \emph{reachable} from $\Vec{x_0}$ if there is a \emph{path} $p = \Vec{x_0},\Vec{x_1}, \Vec{x_2},\ldots, \Vec{x_n}$ , such that
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\forall i \in [0..n],\world_Q(\qfunc{\Vec{x_i}}) = 0$
%\item a robot can move from $\Vec{x_i}$ to $\Vec{x_{i+1}}$ for $i \in [0..n]$, while staying within $\qfunc(\Vec{x_i}) \cup \qfunc(\Vec{x_{i+1}})$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{definition}
%
%A grid rectangle $q\in Q$ is reachable in general, if $\exists \Vec{x}\in D, q = \qfunc(\Vec{x})$ such that $\Vec{x}$ is reachable from either \begin{inparaenum} [(a)]\item the initial position of a robot, or \item another reachable point $\Vec{x^\prime}\in D$. We denote the reachability of a grid rectangle using a predicate $\mathit{Reach} : Q \mapsto \left\{\mathit{True}, \mathit{False}\right\}$, where $\mathit{Reach}(q) = \mathit{True}$ if its reachable,  $\mathit{False}$ otherwise.

%\begin{definition}
%    Given a sound occupancy mapping $\map_i$, the \emph{frontier} of $\map_i$, denoted by $\ff(\map_i)$ is defined as follows:

%\end{definition}
%
%Given a sound occupancy mapping $\map_i$, another sound mapping $\map_i^\prime$ can be constructed as shown in \lem{ext}. Taken in conjunction with our assumption on the initial positions of each robot, this leads to a strategy for computing sound occupancy mapping functions. Further, given a set of sound mappings $\left\{\map_i\right\}_{i\in[N]}$, we can construct a sound mapping $\map$ from them as follows :
