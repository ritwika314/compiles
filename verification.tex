\subsection{Runtime system}



To run a $\lgname$ program (hardware or simulation), the user has to provide a configuration file, with 
\begin{inparaenum}
\item the number of agents, 
\item in case of simulation, the initial positions of the agents and the length of the simulation and 
\item in case of hardware deployment their IP addresses, 
and the localization system.
\end{inparaenum}

\subsection{The Distributed Mapping Problem}
In this section, we introduce the distributed mapping problem that the $\lgname$ program shown in \reffig{mapapp} aims to solve. The key difference between distributed SLAM and this application is that we assume that the robots know their \emph{global coordinates} within the area of deployment. They are only attempting to map it. 
Informally, the problem requires a set of robots to collaboratively agree on positioning of static \emph{obstacles} within a given area $D$, which any robot should avoid while moving in $D$.

\subsubsection{Preliminaries}
We first set up the terminology and assumptions to discuss our approach to this problem. We currently assume that the only sensors available for sensing obstacles are LIDAR based, and the robots are constrained to move in a 2-D space.

The mapping problem is defined over a (\emph{bounded}) domain $D$. In our problem setup, we assume $D$ is a rectangle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ given by $[x_1,x_2]\times [y_1,y_2]$.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{grid quantization} of a bounded domain $D$ is defined as a mapping $\qfunc:D \mapsto \qdom$, where $\qdom$ is a discrete set . If $\qdom$ is, for instance, $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}$, this can be viewed as an embedding of a 2D-lattice in $\mathbb{R}^2$. 
\end{definition}

In theory, we can assume the existence of a \emph{ground truth} function $\world : D\mapsto \left\{0,1\right\}$, where $$\world(\Vec{x}) = \begin{cases}
1\ \mbox{if there is an obstacle at }\Vec{x}\\
0\ \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

This function then naturally extends to any quantization $Q$ of the domain $D$ as 
$\world_Q : Q \mapsto \left\{0,1\right\}$, where $$\world_Q(q) = \begin{cases}
1\ \Leftrightarrow \exists \Vec{x}\in D, \qfunc(\Vec{x}) = q \wedge \world(\Vec{x}) = 1 \\
0\ \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
\rg{Consider also, that there is a set of ground robots $[N]$ in which each robot can reliably detect obstacles within a certain \emph{sensing area} (which we shall presently define) of the current position of the robot.} 
We can then state the 2-d distributed mapping problem, $\mapprob (D, \qfunc, \world) $ as follows. \begin{quote}
 {\em Given a grid quantization $\qfunc$ of a 2-d domain $D\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, a ground truth function $\world$ (extended to $\world_Q$ through $\qfunc$), construct a grid occupancy mapping, $\map: Q \mapsto \left\{1,0,-1\right\}$, where:
 \begin{flalign*}
 \map(q) = 1 &\Rightarrow \world_Q = 1\\
 \map(q) = 0 &\Rightarrow \world_Q = 0\\
 \world_q = 0 &\Rightarrow \map(q) = 0 \mbox{ or } \map(q) = -1\\
  \world_q = 1 &\Rightarrow \map(q) = 1 \mbox{ or } \map(q) = -1\\
 \end{flalign*}
 
 }
\end{quote}

 A vacuously correct solution to $\mapprob(D, \qfunc, \world)$ is $F : Q \mapsto \left\{0,1,-1\right\}, \forall  q \in Q , F(q)= -1$. For a robot $i\in [N]$, let $\pos_{0}(i)$ denote its initial position. To allow for other solutions than the vacuous one stated above, we assume that we are given that initially, each robot starts at a grid square with no obstacle, and the grid occupancy function $\map$ is initialized as such:
 $\forall i \in [N], \world_Q(\qfunc(\pos_{0}(i))) = 0$ and 
 $\forall i \in [N], \map(\qfunc(\pos_{0}(i))) = 0$.

 Let $\pos_t(i)$ denote the position of robot $i$ at time $t$. Let $\map_i:Q\mapsto \left\{-1,0,1\right\}$ denote a \emph{proposed} map function from the perspective of robot $i$,: where $\map_i(q) = 0$ when robot $i$ doesn't sense an obstacle in $q$, $\map_i(q) = 1$ when it does, and $\map_i(q) = -1$ otherwise. 
 \begin{definition} The \emph{sensing area} of a robot $i$ at time $t$ is defined by $\sensarea: Q \mapsto 2^{Q}$, where given $\qfunc(\pos_t(i)) = Q \Rightarrow \map_i(Q) = 0$, and  $\map_i(\sensarea(q)) = 0$ or $\map_i(\sensarea(q)) = 1$. 
  \end{definition}
  
  
We assume that at time $t$, if robot $i$ detects an obstacle in $q \in \sensarea(\qfunc(\pos_t(i)))$ , then the $q$ does contain an obstacle, otherwise it does not. The point of this presentation isn't dealing with the issue of potentially false positives while identifying an obstacle. A robot partially constructs a grid occupancy function by assigning values to the grid squares in its \emph{sensed} area.
