\subsection{Runtime system}



To run a $\lgname$ program (hardware or simulation), the user has to provide a configuration file, with 
\begin{inparaenum}
\item the number of agents, 
\item in case of simulation, the initial positions of the agents and the length of the simulation and 
\item in case of hardware deployment their IP addresses, 
and the localization system.
\end{inparaenum} 

\subsection{Key environment assumptions} 


\subsubsection{Periodic event execution semantics}


\subsubsection{Shared variable implementation over message passing}


\subsubsection{Known set of participants}
\subsubsection{Portability and heterogeneity}


\subsection{Simulator}
\subsubsection{gazebo environment}
\subsubsection{car model}
\subsubsection{lidar}
\subsubsection{positioning}
\subsubsection{sampled sensing}
\subsubsection{synchronization issues}
 
\subsection{The Distributed Mapping Algorithm}
\subsubsection{Motivation}


\subsubsection{Formal Problem statement}
\rg{Initialize local map to be 0 at current position, and 0 for a surrounding ball. No lidar required to start with. Then move to max explored map. }
\rg{define inputs, outputs, assumptions here. }
\subsection{Library Functions}


\subsubsection{Correctness and Soundness}
\rg{define notion of soundness}
\emph{Theorem1} State correctness and soundness condition with assumptions, proof for ~\reffig{mapapp}.
