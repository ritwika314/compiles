\begin{abstract}
% Why
A program for a robot in an ensemble interacts with its physical environment using sensors and actuators, and with other robots,  over a network. Current languages and tools do not provide the necessary platform-independent abstractions nor the portability. Therefore, developing these applications  require detailed knowledge of control theory, path planning, network protocols, and numerous platform-specific details.  We present a domain specific language called \lgname which abstracts platform-specific functions for sensing, communication, and low-level control, and makes  the platform-independent control and coordination code portable,  and modularly verifiable. \lgname raises the level of abstraction in programming  by providing distributed shared memory for coordination and port interfaces for sensing and control. We present the complete formal executable semantics of \lgname in the \K framework. 
With the symbolic execution provided by the \K engine, we can identify all proof obligations for formally verifying \lgname applications. Platform independent proof obligations can be discharged using Z3 and platform specific proof obligations can be tested by deploying the   applications on the \lgname simulator and on actual vehicle and quadcopter platforms. 
%Our high-fidelity $\lgname$ simulator can be used to test, visualize, and debug platform-specific sensing and control functions. 
We illustrate the power of $\lgname$ by creating and verifying three applications: formation flight, distributed task allocation, and distributed mapping.
